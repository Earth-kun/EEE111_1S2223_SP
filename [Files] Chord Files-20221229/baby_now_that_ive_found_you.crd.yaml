      Baby, now that I've found you
              4
      I won't let you go

      I need you so,
           4

      Baby, baby,
           4
      when first we met
        4                      4
      I knew in this heart of mine
      4                       4
      That you were someone I couldn't forget.
             4
      I said right,
                   4
      and abide my time

      Spent my life looking
      4
      for that somebody
      2           2          2 1 1
      to make me feel like new
      4                        4
      Now you tell me that you want to leave me
      4                   4
      But darling, I just can't let you
