      I still hear your voice, when you sleep next to me.
        4               4           8
      I still feel your touch in my dream. (in my dream)
         4          4             4            4
      Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why,
          4             4       8
      Without you, it's hard to survive.

      'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling.
                        2       2             4
      And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly.
                        2          2
      Can't you feel my heart beat fast?
        2            2
      I want this to last.
      4              4
      Need you by my side.


                           2        2        4
      'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static.
                        2       2             4
      And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky.
                        2          2
      Can't you hear my heart beat so?
        2             2
      I can't let you go.
      4              4
      Want you in my life.

      Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky.
           4         4          8
      They wipe away tears that I cry. (that I cry)
          4            4                4                 4
      The good and the bad times: we've been through them all.
      4           4         8
      You make me rise when I fall.
