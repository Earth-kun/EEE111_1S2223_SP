      4                  4
      First when there's nothing
            4              4
      But a slow glowing dream
                4            4
      That your fear seems to hide
             3        1 4
      Deep inside your mind

   
            4           4
      All alone, I have cried
             4             4
      Silent tears full of pride
           4             4
      In a world made of steel
              4    4    4     4
      Made of stone

      Well, I hear the music
               4              4
      Close my eyes, feel the rhythm
            4             4          4    4
      Wrap around, take a hold of my heart

             2       1 1 2 2
      What a feeling
                2       1 1 2 2
      Being's believing
            2       2
      I can have it all
              2       2      8
      Now I'm dancing for my life


                2      1 1 2 2
      Take your passion
                  2     1 1 2 2
      And make it happen
               2      2
      Pictures come alive
              2           2            8
      You can dance right through your life
