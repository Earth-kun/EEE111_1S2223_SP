        4           2      2        4
      A place where nobody dared to go
          4                    4      
      The love that we came to know
                   4     4   4
      They call it Xanadu
           4   2         2        4
      And now, open your eyes and see
      4                    4      
      What we have made is real
                4      4    4
      We are in Xanadu

      A million lights are dancing
          4                2        4
      And there you are, a shooting star
      4      4
      An everlasting world
                 4              4        2  2 
      And you're here with me, eternally
